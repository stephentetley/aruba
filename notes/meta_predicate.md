# SWI Prolog meta_predicate

Quick note.  

The syntax seems to be close to a type signature.

If a predicate has five arguments, the tuple will have five members.

Higher-order arguments (goals) have their arity listed e.g. (2, 4 or whatever).

Other arguments have their mode listed (+ is input, - is output, ? is nondet).
